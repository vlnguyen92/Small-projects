### Course Projects

This is a collection of small course projects (either from my class at HSC or from an online course) and independent projects (just for fun).
Currently have:

1. Beargit - A subset of git, the first project from [CS61C at Berkeley].
2. Backflow Algorithm - Schedule jobs based on the number of processors, course project from CS262 (Data Structures)
3. ERG - An android app for visualizing weather data from [Weather Underground](www.wunderground.com)
4. Canal Boat - An animation of the Canal Boat (final project for CS331 (Graphics))
5. Compiler - Compiler for a subset of C (final project for CS480 (Compilers))
6. Social Network - a social network prototye that supports friendships, postings, messages, FB-style.
